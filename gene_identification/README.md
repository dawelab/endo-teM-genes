# These scripts identify the different gene sets, including endosperm teM genes, FMEGs, endsoeprm specific genes, and core genes.

1. Calclute the TPM, the input data was generated by RNA_Seq_Mapping, the TPM algorithm is   

   $$
    \mathrm {TPM}_i = \frac{\frac{n_i}{l_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{j} \left( n_i/l_i \right) \times 10^6
   $$                 
           
$$
\mathrm{TPM}_i = \frac{\frac{n_i}{l_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{J} \left( \frac{n_j}{l_j} \right)} \times 10^6
$$
