# These scripts identify the different gene sets, including endosperm teM genes, FMEGs, endsoeprm specific genes, and core genes.

1. Calclute the TPM, the input data was generated by RNA_Seq_Mapping, the TPM algorithm is   

   $$
    \mathrm TPM_i = \frac{\frac{n_i}{l_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{j} \left( n_i/l_i \right) \times 10^6
   $$
